I was playing Hades and getting excited for the next Diablo release so I thought I would have a little look online to learn about generating dungeons and thought I might as well have a go implementing in Unity.

I used this article from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/procedural-dungeon-generation-algorithm">gamasutra</a> (which rebranded while i made this post)
And had some fun replicating part of it but also had some problems applying it to an isometric game.
I started getting some ideas for a fun pixel art style game about exploring an underground flooded city in a cyberpunk future. Only problem was that I had no art experience and I soon realized the project would be very art intensive so I decided to stop working on it.

If you go to the annoucement update for the game you can walk around a dungeon but there isn't much else to do im afraid.

I also had a big problem wil walls and doors so that why they look so weird in the pics below.
