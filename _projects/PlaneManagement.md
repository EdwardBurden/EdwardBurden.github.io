This was a game I made in a weekend (may have been a day actually) with a very simple premise.You control planes as they take off from airports and land. The controls are intentionally a little difficult, since the longer you hold the more the planes rotate, but as you can see in the video the game becomes a spinning plate scenario where you need to manage way too many planes at once.
