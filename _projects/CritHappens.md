 <p class="col-md-6 col-12"> I had been playing a lot of divinity original sin and really enjoyed the depth of that game, and i was bored so why not try mimicking it in Unity. I wanted to switch between roaming around to combat and have the NPCâ€™s also switch into combat if triggered or run away if they were civilians.

 <p class="col-md-6 col-12"> Looking back now I actually had put in a lot more effort into making the game then I remember, I even had a tool for creating characters which was accessible from the inspector. And NPC's had a whole state machine system set up so they could be assigned to triggers to join/start fights. They could even be set to 'run home' and leave a fight area or accidently run into it and would return to their original behaviour after the fight finishes.

I think this project could have used  more prior planning and I really vastly underestimated the amount of work required to make even a simple RPG prototype.Around this time I also moved to London and changed job so the game went on the shelf soon after.
