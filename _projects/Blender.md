I was getting frustrated that all my previous projects had awful art but I didn't want to just buy unity asset store models and throw them in my games. I wanted to learn more about how assets are made and imported into Unity.

I started with Blender Guruâ€™s course and made 3 assets here on the website. Not all of them look great but I'm happy with my progress. I used this knowledge I gained from the tutorials to make some assets for prototyping my new game Freight and it really helped to be able to visualize how the game would look. Also having more than just moving blocks gave me more motivation to keep working on the game.
