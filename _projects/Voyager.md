This prototype was just a bit of a fun thing to work on where you could save and load a configuration of a spaceship then fly it around the map. At one point even had a simple local multiplayer system with controller support. In the end it wasn't something I was serious about continuing since building the spaceships was a little too tedious to be a fun game.
