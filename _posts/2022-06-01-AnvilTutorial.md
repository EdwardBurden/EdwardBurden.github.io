 <p> Here's one I want to go back and redo from the start. It doesn't look too bad when viewed in blender but I had run into too many problems when trying to sculpt the anvil at the end and then had even more problems getting the texturing to work too.

I know I can make it look better if I give it a second go at some point. I'm posting it here anyway as a reminder for myself to go back and redo when I have more time to devote to Blender.

After (not) finishing the anvil tutorial I started thinking about a game I wanted to make and made a series of bad blender models that fit the purpose of working in the game, at least so that I could have something more that capsules to look at.
