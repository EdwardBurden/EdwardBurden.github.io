   <p class="col-md-6 col-12"> After finishing the Donut tutorial I started working on a homework task to create a cupcake using the techniques I had learnt from a few tutorials.I found it very challenging and I'm not 100% happy with the final product, i struggled to get the correct shape of the base of the cupcake and had some problems with textexturing the paper too.

 <p class="col-md-6 col-12"> Overall I do feel I learnt a lot from this exercise and when viewed from a distance I think it looks okay, I'm especially happy with the color of the top of the cupcake.I spent some time getting the crust to look the way i wanted.
